## What is bettercollected? [ðŸ”—](https://bettercollected.com)

<hr/>
Better collected is a form builder platform that allows user to show that they care about their responders's data by allowing 
them to set purpose of the data collection which the responder gives consent to before submitting any form. In addition, it also allows the 
responder to view his/her submission and request for deletion of that response.

It provides a workspace that can be used to host all the forms in a single place.
