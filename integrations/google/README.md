### Running the project

**NOTE: Latest codebase is in develop branch**

1. Install `pyenv` with `python` version `3.10` and higher. And activate a virtual environment.
2. Look into [Makefile](Makefile) to see if you might need any command. If you need additional commands, you can add it there.

4. Copy [.env.example](.env.example) with the name `.env`, and add/update the environment variables there. <br/>
   (**Note: Keep `AUTH_AEX_HEX_KEY` and `GOOGLE_AES_KEY` same through every project for bettercollected**)<br/>
(**Note: Keep `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` values same through every project for bettercollected**)
5. After configuring the environment variables, the application is ready to run
6. Run `uvicorn googleform.app:get_application --reload --port 8003 --env-file .env`
