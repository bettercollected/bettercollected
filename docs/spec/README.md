# Form spec v1

A form as a JSON document: everything its creator controls, in one versioned
shape. The JSON Schema is [`form-spec-v1.schema.json`](form-spec-v1.schema.json).

The schema is generated from the models in `common/common/form_spec/models.py`.
After you change them, regenerate it from `common/`:

```bash
uv run python -m common.form_spec.schema
```

A test fails when the committed file is out of date.

## Shape

| Key | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `specVersion` | Always `"1"`. Required. |
| `title`, `description` | The form's title and description. |
| `welcomePage` | Title, description, layout, image and button text of the first screen. |
| `pages` | The question pages in order. Each page has an `id`, an optional `sectionTitle`, `layout`, `imageUrl`, `theme` override, `showQuestionNumbers`, flow-view `position`, `jumps` (branching) and its `fields`. |
| `endings` | The pages shown after submitting. Each has an `id` (given when left out), an internal `name`, `isDefault` (at most one; else the first ending is the default), `title`, `message`, `buttonText`, `buttonLink`, `layout` and `imageUrl`. |
| `theme` | Colours, background and style. |
| `hiddenFields` | URL parameter names captured with each response (names only). |
| `logo` | Position, alt text and whether to use the workspace logo. `url` is read-only: a logo is set by uploading it. |
| `trust` | Purpose, retention text, privacy policy link, retention period, and the identity, editing and submission-number switches. |

A field has an `id`, a `type` and a `title` (plain text, or a rich-text
document that can pipe answers). Depending on the type it also has `choices`,
`validations` (`required`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `minValue`, `maxValue`,
`pattern`, `minChoices`, `maxChoices`), `colSpan` (1 to 12), `logic` (show or
hide it), `dateRules`, `whyWeAsk`, `internal`, and for a repeating group
`repeat` and its own `fields`. Unknown keys are refused. Types the builder
no longer offers are marked `deprecated` in the schema: they are still
accepted so that older forms can be read, and validation warns about them.

Ids are chosen by the writer and must be unique within the form. Logic
conditions and page jumps refer to them; a jump's `target` is a page id or
`"__SUBMIT__"`. A jump to `"__SUBMIT__"` may add `endingId` to show that
ending after submitting instead of the default one. Endings stored before
they had ids are given `ending-<n>` (their position, from 1) when read, so
the same form always shows the same ids.

## What is not in the document

- Data the server owns: workspace, owner and form ids, timestamps, publish
  state, response counts, sharing settings, actions and their secrets.
- Derived data: positions (`index`), which follow the array order.
- Data only first-generation and imported forms use (the old rule engine,
  provider references, the consent list). Forms that are not built from
  pages have no spec document.

Converting a form to a document and back keeps everything else
(`common/common/form_spec/roundtrip.py` states this as code, and tests
check it).

## Example

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1",
  "title": "Event sign-up",
  "welcomePage": { "title": "Event sign-up", "buttonText": "Start" },
  "pages": [
    {
      "id": "page-1",
      "fields": [
        {
          "id": "name",
          "type": "short_text",
          "title": "Your name",
          "validations": { "required": true, "maxLength": 80 }
        },
        {
          "id": "dinner",
          "type": "yes_no",
          "title": "Will you join the dinner?",
          "choices": [{ "value": "Yes" }, { "value": "No" }]
        },
        {
          "id": "diet",
          "type": "short_text",
          "title": "Any dietary needs?",
          "logic": {
            "action": "SHOW",
            "conditions": [
              { "fieldId": "dinner", "comparison": "IS_EQUAL", "value": "Yes" }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "endings": [{ "title": "Thanks", "message": "See you there." }],
  "trust": {
    "purpose": "To plan seats and catering.",
    "retention": { "type": "days", "value": 30 }
  }
}
```

## Checking and previewing

- `POST /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/forms/validate` checks a document
  and returns `{valid, errors: [{path, message}], warnings, compliance}`.
- `POST /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/forms/{form_id}/ops/dry-run` applies
  edit operations to a copy of a form and returns the resulting document, a
  diff and per-operation results. Nothing is stored.

Both need permission to edit forms in the workspace. A document can be at
most 1 MB, with at most 200 pages and 2000 fields in all (group questions
included); a batch can have at most 200 operations. The MCP server offers
the same as `validate_form`, `dry_run_ops` and `get_form_spec`.
